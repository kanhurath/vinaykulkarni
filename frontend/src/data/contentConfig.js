  bio: "Vinay Kulkarni brings over 25 years of global experience in business management and wellness as an entrepreneur, advisor, educator, and marketer. His focus spans business transformation and the meaningful integration of Dharmic principles into organizational practice. He created the Dharmic Enterprise Framework, a model that helps organizations align profit with purpose and evolve as Dharmic enterprises. In Bengaluru, he established a cultural center housing The Upadesha Academy (IKS based workshops & retreats), Darshana Books & Gifts (Indic), and Samvada Bistro—where he explores his passion for fusion cuisine blending traditional Indian and international flavors— alongside ventures including ALCHMI, Sanskritishaala (cultural workshops for children & youth), and Sanathani.com (Indic merchandise). Through this ecosystem, he works to embed Dharmic principles across business, education, and governance.",
